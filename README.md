# JPaint! A simple pixel art software made in Java

## What does it use?

- Java Swing and Java AWT 

## What is JPaint?:

JPaint is a bare-bones minimalistic pixel art software designed to provide the user with a robust, stable, and extremely simple environment. This is to allow users to only focus on one goal in mind, just make pixel art! Due to the simple nature of this program, 
animations are not included as that is incredibly complex to implement. However, JPaint will allow you to create, and export your pixel art in either *.png* or *.jpg* file formats as those are the most popular. JPaint wants to make sure the user has what it 
needs, from a near infinite amount of colors to make and choose, to a grid that they can resize to anything they want (please bear in mind the bigger you make it the more power it uses obviously). Since this was created with Java and the Java UI Libraries, this 
can work with MAC-OS, and Windows 8+, this has *NOT* been tested with popular Linux distros such as Ubuntu but due to the "write once run everywhere" nature or Java, it should work, right?

## "Bare-Bones"
As mentioned before, this project is "bare-bones" but what does that mean? Well in the plain terms, this is not some 
top tier corporate software with hundreds of features, it's supposed to give the artist what they need, a grid they can 
resize, and any color they want, with (hopefully) the ability to export to *.png* and *.jpg* file formats in a future update.

## Prerequisites: 
- Latest JDK and JRE is recommended but any JDK or JRE should work from 2016 and onward.

## Future updates:

- Create full support for file exportation in .png & .jpg
- Update grid resizer
- Create Node resizer
- Release installable JAR file
