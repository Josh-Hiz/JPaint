# JPaint! A simple pixel art program made in Java

## What does it use?

- Java Swing and Java AWT

## Quick Notes:

- This is merely just a simple implementation of similar small pixel art programs and nothing extra has been added, the
  colors you can use can be selected from the JMenuBar on the top left and the colors include:

1. Orange
2. Blue
3. Black
4. Gray
5. Dark Gray
6. Red
7. Green
8. Etc (All base standard colors provided by the Java Swing and Java AWT graphics classes)

## Future updates:

Create a save function/button that will be placed next to the select colors menu that will allow you to export your
current pixel art to a .jpg or .png file
